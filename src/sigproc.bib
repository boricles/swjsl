	and share tools that operate on such a provenance model. (3) To define

	a digital representation of provenance for any 'thing', whether produced
	by computer systems or not. (5) To allow multiple levels of description

	inferences that can be made on provenance representation. This document
	contains the specification of the Open Provenance Model (v1.1) resulting
